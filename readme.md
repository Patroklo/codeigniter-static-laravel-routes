# CodeIgniter Laravel-like static routes and filters

A little group or libraries that let Codeigniter work as a static routing system with filters as simmilar to the Laravel routing system as I could have done.


Written by Joseba Juániz ([@Patroklo](http://twitter.com/Patroklo)).
Based on the routing work of ([Bonfire team](http://cibonfire.com/)).


## Requirements

Codeigniter 3.x
(Working to release it in CI 2.X)

Php 5.2 or above

## Licensing

For now I'm not licensing this work. It has some code from the Bonfire Project, wich keeps their license rights.


## Installation

Just put copy the files into your server using the same folder structure. If you have a previously installed module system as HMVC you could have to overwrite the MY_Route files. If that's the case and you have any trouble making it, just ask for directions about that.


## Change Log

### 1.0:
*	First release of the system. Added static routes, filter hook system and naming routes system.
