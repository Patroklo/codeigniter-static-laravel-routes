# CodeIgniter Laravel-like static routes and filters

A little group or libraries that let Codeigniter work as a static routing system with filters as simmilar to the Laravel routing system as I could have done.


Written by Joseba JuÃ¡niz ([@Patroklo](http://twitter.com/Patroklo)).
Based on the routing work of ([Bonfire team](http://cibonfire.com/)).


## Requirements

Codeigniter 3.x (not plans of 2.x library)

Php 5.3 or above

## Licensing

For now I'm not licensing this work. It has some code from the Bonfire Project, wich keeps their license rights.


## Future plans

- Adding subdomain routing.

## Installation

Just put copy the files into your server using the same folder structure. If the developer have a previously installed module system as HMVC the developer could have to overwrite the MY_Route files. If that's the case and the developer have any trouble making it, just ask for directions about that.


## Routing tutorial

The developer can use all the HTML methods to define a Route. This route will only be generated if the query of the page coincides with it's method. Meaning that if the developer make a GET call to the server, the library will only make the GET routes, leaving the rest as not existant. This also can be used by the developer to make a RESTFUL server.

### Basic routing

The basic methods are: 

	
	Route::get('user', 			'user/index');
	Route::post('user/(:any)', 	'user/load/$1');
	Route::put('user/(:any), 	'user/update/$1');
	Route::delete('user/(:any)','user/delete/$1');
	Route::head('user', 		'user/index');
	Route::patch('user/(:any), 	'user/update/$1');
	Route::options('user/(:any),'user/load/$1');
	
The developer can also use two additional functions that let the route to be generated in more than one method:

`any` will work with any HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE...).

 	```
 	Route::any('user', 			'user/index');
	```
`match` lets the developer to define manually wich methods will be accepted by this route.
 
 	```
 	Route::match(array('GET', 'POST'), 'user', 'user/index');
	```

### Named routes

The developer can name a route. That will let him to call this name instead of using all the route in the future.


 	```
 	Route::set_name('user_update', 'admin/user/load/');
 	
 	Route::get('user', 'user/index', array('as' => 'user'));
	```

Calling a named route:
 
 	```
 	echo Route::named('user');
 	
 	redirect(Route::named('user'));
	```

### Named parameters

The developer can also define named parameters in each route instead of using wildcars or regular expressions. This will let the developer use them also in the URI with their defined names.
If the developer don't define a named parameter, it will be used a an `(:any)` in the route.

	```
	Route::any('user/{id}',		'user/load/$1');
	```

There are two kinds of parameter definitions. The global definition, that will set a wildcar or regular expression to every named parameter with that name in the routes file and the local definition, that will only affect to the Route in wich it's defined.

Global parameter definition:

	```
	Route::pattern('id',		'/[0-9]+/');
	Route::pattern('name',		'(:any)');
	```

Local parameter definition:

	```
	Route::post('user/{id}', 	'user/load/$1')->where('id', '/[0-9]+/');
	```

Multiple local parameter definition;

	```
	Route::post('user/{id}/{name}', 	'user/load/$1/$2')->where(array('id' => '/[0-9]+/', 'name' => '(:any)'));
	```
	
### Optional parameters

There can be defined optional parameters. That will let Codeigniter use that route as much as there is or isn't a URI defined in that position.
The parameter definition is the same as the normal Named Parameters (the parameter name without the question mark "?").

	```
	Route::any('user/{id?}', 	'user/load/$1')->where('id', '/[0-9]+/');
	```
	
This will let the developer use "user" and "user/12" as routes using Codeigniter the method load in the controller user in both calls.

The developer can also stack multiple optional parameters like this and all the possible permutations of the optional uris will be defined automatically:

	```
	Route::any('user/{id?}/{name?}/{telephone?}', 	'user/load/$1/$2/$3')->where('id', '/[0-9]+/');
	```

### Accessing named and optional parameters

Codeigniter will store a list of this parameters in the URI library, so the developer can access them using their name instead of the position in the uri segment.

	```
	$user_id = $this->uri->segment('id');
	
	$user_name = $this->uri->rsegment('name');
	```

### Route filters

The developer can also define route filters. That will execute the defined methods before or after the controller execution.
This is useful for adding additional info or making previous checks, like if the user is logged in.

Filter definition:

	```
	Route::filter('logged_in', function(){
	
		if($this->auth->logged_in() == FALSE)
		{	
			show_404();
		}
	
	});
	```
This code will be executed immediately after the CI_Controller construction or after the method calling, so the developer can use all the auto loaded files and also load new ones with `$this->load` if it's neccesary.

Adding a filter to a route:

The developer can define two filter callings, `before` a route calling and `after` the route execution.

	```
	Route::any('user/{id}',	'user/load/$1', array('before' => 'logged_in'));
	```

This will launch the logged_in check before Codeigniter calls the `load` method, so if the user it's not logged in, instead will receive a 404 error display.

Passing multiple filters

	```
	Route::any('user/{id}',	'user/load/$1', array('before' => array('logged_in', 'check_params')));
	Route::any('user/{id}',	'user/load/$1', array('after' => 'logged_in|check_params'));
	```

### Route groups

This lets the developer add a prefix to every route inside it. This it's useful for defining admin routes, for example.

	```
	Route::prefix('admin', function(){
	
		Route::prefix('user', function(){
				
				Route::post('update/(:any)', 'user/update/$1');
				
		});
	
	});
	```

Another way of define route groups

	```
	Route::any('admin', 'admin/index', array(), function(){

		Route::any('user', 'user/index');

	});
	```

### RESTFUL like routes

	```
	Route::resources('photos');
	```

This will autocreate all this routes:

  GET     /photos         index       displaying a list of photos
  GET     /photos/new     create_new  return an HTML form for creating a photo
  POST    /photos         create      create a new photo
  GET     /photos/{id}    show        display a specific photo
  GET     /photos/{id}/edit   edit    return the HTML form for editing a single photo
  PUT     /photos/{id}    update      update a specific photo
  DELETE  /photos/{id}    delete      delete a specific photo


### Auto routes

The developer can make with one call a 6 tier route definition

	```
	Route::context('photos', 'photo');
	```

  photo/(:any)/(:any)/(:any)/(:any)/(:any)/(:any)    	$1/photo/$2/$3/$4/$5/$6
  photo/(:any)/(:any)/(:any)/(:any)/(:any)				$1/photo/$2/$3/$4/$5
  photo/(:any)/(:any)/(:any)/(:any)						$1/photo/$2/$3/$4
  photo/(:any)/(:any)/(:any)							$1/photo/$2/$3
  photo/(:any)/(:any)									$1/photo/$2
  photo/(:any)											$1/photo

### Block routes

Not very useful now that Codeigniter only has static routes with this library, but the developer can also block manually routes.

	```
	Route::block('user/(:any)');
	```
Will generate a blank route to this uris that, eventually, will led to a 404 display error.
